# belly-button-challenge

For this assignment, an interactive dashboard was created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize the human navels.

This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species aka operational taxonomic units or OTU's were present in more than 70% of people. 

In short, the dashboard allows users to investigate microbial biodiversities by selecting a test subject ID to view demographic data. A bar chart of the top 10 OTU's will be present, a bubble chart of all OTU's in the sample, and a demographic information panel will also show key metadata such as age, location, wash frequency, etc. 

Technologies Used:
JavaScript, D3.js, Plotly.js, GitHub Pages.
